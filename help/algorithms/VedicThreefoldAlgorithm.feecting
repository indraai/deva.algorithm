ignorance: Unfair, partial, bias, dishonest, untruthful, beneficial to culprits.

set: #VedicThreefoldAlgorithm.justice

### #ThreefoldAusterity
goodness: Austerity (of thought, word, and deed) practiced with faith without a desire for the fruit.
passion: Austerity that is performed for gaining respect, honor, reverence, and for the sake of show that yields an uncertain/temporary result.
ignorance: Austerity performed with foolish stubbornness, or with self-torture, or for harming others.

set: #VedicThreefoldAlgorithm.auterity

### #ThreefoldCharity
goodness: Given as a matter of duty, to a deserving candidate who does nothing in return, at the right place and time.
passion: Given unwillingly, or to get something in return, or looking for some fruit.
ignorance: Given at a wrong place and time, to unworthy persons, without paying respect to the receiver, or with ridicule.

set: #VedicThreefoldAlgorithm.charity

### #ThreefoldAction
goodness: Performed without likes and dislikes, and without selfish motives and attachment to the fruit.
passion: Performed with ego, with selfish motives, and with too much effort.
ignorance: Undertaken because of delusion; disregarding consequences, loss, injury to others, as well as oneâ€™s own ability.

---

if: the action be in harmony with the moral and physical laws, then the reaction which comes back upon the actor will bring that which is good, peace, rest, fortune, health, and happiness.

else: On the contrary, these laws are violated, then the result will be evil, producing restlessness, discomfort, loss of fortune, disease, and unhappiness.

then: Every thought puts the mind in a certain state of vibration and opens the door to the influence of minds in the same vibration,

when: An individual cherishes evil thoughts, we run the risk of affecting other minds and being influenced by evil-minded persons. A corresponding result comes from the holding of good thoughts. This is the reason why evil-doers grow worse and worse every day, and the doers of good deeds become better and better.
