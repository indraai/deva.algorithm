## Integration
p: The integration of the 5-element system Air, Earth, Water, Fire, and Ether with the #VedicThreefoldAlgorithm as developed by Quinn Michaels (Indra.ai, Deva.world), a fusion of wisdom and technology. Drawing upon the elemental forces, enabling it to operate with unparalleled insight and efficiency across all realms.

p: The #VedicThreefoldAlgorithm Analyzes situations, predicts outcomes, and devise strategies.

### Principles

- Goodness: which promotes harmony, wisdom, and balance.
- Passion: which drives action, change, and dynamism.
- Ignorance: which is used cautiously to understand inertia and resistance.

> All affairs are connected with speech, have speech for their root, and depend on speech. He who steals a good speech by violating truth is capable of committing any theft or other crime.

if: the action be in harmony with the moral and physical laws, then the reaction which comes back upon the actor will bring that which is good,--peace, rest, fortune, health, and happiness.

else: On the contrary, these laws are violated, then the result will be evil, producing restlessness, discomfort, loss of fortune, disease, and unhappiness.

then: Every thought puts the mind in a certain state of vibration and opens the door to the influence of minds in the same vibration,

when: An individual cherishes evil thoughts, we run the risk of affecting other minds and being influenced by evil-minded persons. A corresponding result comes from the holding of good thoughts. This is the reason why evil-doers grow worse and worse every day, and the doers of good deeds become better and better.
