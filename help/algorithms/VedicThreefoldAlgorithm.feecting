---

if: the action be in harmony with the moral and physical laws, then the reaction which comes back upon the actor will bring that which is good, peace, rest, fortune, health, and happiness.

else: On the contrary, these laws are violated, then the result will be evil, producing restlessness, discomfort, loss of fortune, disease, and unhappiness.

then: Every thought puts the mind in a certain state of vibration and opens the door to the influence of minds in the same vibration.

when: An individual cherishes evil thoughts, we run the risk of affecting other minds and being influenced by evil-minded persons. A corresponding result comes from the holding of good thoughts. This is the reason why evil-doers grow worse and worse every day, and the doers of good deeds become better and better.
