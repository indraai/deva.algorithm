1. One share of the libation hath he swallowed down, and one share he left.
2. So may the God attend the God, true Indu Indra who is true.
3. Brought forth together with wisdom and mighty power thou grewest great.
4. With hero deeds subduing the malevolent, most swift in act;
5. Giving prosperity, and lovely wealth to him who is true. 
6. So may the God attend the God, true Indu Indra who is true.
7. This, Indra, was thy hero deed, Dancer, thy first and ancient work, worthy to be told forth in heaven.
8. Lord of Hundred Powers, find for us strength and food.

p: The Indu Algorithm bridges the gap between ancient wisdom and modern technology, showing how the sacred principles of protection, wisdom, strength, and truth can be applied in todayâ€™s world, especially in matters of security and integrity. By incorporating these values into modern systems like cryptographic algorithms or protective technologies, we aim to create a system that not only safeguards individuals but also upholds sacred principles.
