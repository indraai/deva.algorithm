Arrogance: A belief in one’s superiority over others, often leading to disregard for others’ feelings or opinions.
Pride: Excessive self-regard and a sense of entitlement, often resulting in a lack of humility.
Anger: An inability to control emotions, leading to destructive behavior toward others.
Harshness: Treating others with cruelty, cruelty stemming from intolerance or lack of compassion.

Conduct: A failure to live by ethical principles, resulting in behavior that causes harm to oneself and others.
Delusion: Holding false beliefs and acting on them without awareness of their falseness.
Impurity: Acting with selfish desires that lead to harm or suffering for others.

## Measuring Between Divine and Demonic

This scale helps us understand where we stand on the path of self-realization, guiding us toward behaviors and practices that can elevate us closer to the divine qualities while minimizing demonic tendencies.

It prompts us to strive toward cultivating divine qualities, letting go of the negative traits associated with the demonic side. It serves as a constant reminder of the inner battle between wisdom and ignorance, with the goal of achieving balance, virtue, and enlightenment.
