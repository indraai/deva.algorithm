# Gift Algorithm 

1. A gift to one who is not a Brahmana yields the ordinary reward. 
2. A gift to one who calls himself a Brahmana, a double reward. 
3. A gift to a well-read Brahmana, a hundred-thousandfold reward. 
4. A gift to one who knows the Veda and the Angas (Vedaparaga, a reward) without end. 

p: For according to the particular qualities of the recipient and according to the faith of the giver a small or a great reward will be obtained for a gift in the next world.
