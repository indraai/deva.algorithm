# b5(9³)

img: /assets/algorithms/b593/image.png

## Step 1: Understanding the Base Grid

p: The base grid provided:

```
1 3 5 7 9
9 1 3 5 7
7 9 1 3 5
5 7 9 1 3
3 5 7 9 1
```

p: This is a repeating cyclic sequence of numbers arranged in a 5x5 grid. Each row is a shifted version of the sequence `{1, 3, 5, 7, 9}`. It represents the Base 5 (B5) system, where each number corresponds to a symbolic or elemental value:

- 1: Ether/Space/Sound/Ear/White
- 3: Air/Wind/Touch/Skin/Yellow
- 5: Light/Fire/Color/Eye/Red
- 7: Water/Taste/Flavor/Tongue/Blue
- 9: Earth/Smell/Scent/Nose/Green

p: This grid serves as the foundation for constructing geometric and numerical patterns, starting with the 5 elements as seen in the red horizontal base in the diagram.

---

## Step 2: Rotating the Grid

p: Rotating the grid 45 degrees counter-clockwise aligns diagonal axes and emphasizes the horizontal line of 1s, creating what is termed the Base Horizon. This rotation serves two critical purposes:

1.	Establishes a fixed reference axis for subsequent geometric derivations.
2.	Reveals inter-element relationships along diagonal trajectories, which form the foundation for multi-dimensional mapping.

p: This rotation emphasizes the horizontal line of 1 Ether, creating the Base Horizon (Base 5). The horizontal 1s in the rotated grid represent the 5 elements (Ether, Air, Light, Water, Earth), providing the foundation for the subsequent geometric relationships.

p: From the rotated grid, inter-element connections form a hexagram (6-pointed star):

- Ether Horizon (1s): establishes horizontal equilibrium.
- Air Downward Triangle (3s): indicates upward movement and expansion.
- Light Quadrant (5s): represents perception-focused mapping.
- Water Quadrant (7s): represents adaptable flows and transformations.
- Earth Upward Triangle (9s): signifies stability and grounding.


---

## Step 3: Identifying the Grid Pattern

p: From the rotated grid, specific numbers are highlighted—3 and 9. When we connect these values geometrically, we form a 6-pointed star pattern, symbolizing interlacing triangles (a hexagram).

p: The rotation of the grid forms the first observable which is a line of 1 1 1 1 1 or 5 single 1s. This forms the horizon line signal repeater, or the Base 5 Mathematics for the Grid Expansion when multiple grids are stacked or linked together this horizontal focus forms the base5 expansion math when scaleing grids in 2d and 3d space. From this forms the first question.

q: The single 1 at the center is it forcing itself to be honest with the single 1 around it or forcing the single 1 around it to discover dishonesty. This is the Algorithm of Inernal External Force of Inside Outside Outside Inside Logic. 
p: This pattern is derived by:
1. Taking the positions of the 1s and connecting them to forms Ether Horizon.
2. Taking the positions of the 3s and connecting them to forms Air Downward Triangle.
3. Taking the positions of the 5s and connecting them to forms Light Quadrant.
4. Taking the positions of the 7s and connecting them to forms Water Quadrant.
5. Taking the positions of the 9s and connecting them to forms Earth Upward triangle.

p: The resulting paradigm represents b5(9³), where:
- 5: The base grid is grounded in the 5 elements.
- 9³: Represents a cubic relationship derived from multiplying 9 (Earth) over power of 3 (Air) times over in a symbolic 5 (Light) and 7 (water) quadrant, dimensional expansion.

---

## Step 4: Extrapolating the Geometry and Meaning

p: From here, the algorithm can extrapolate deeper layers of meaning and structure.

### Numerical Relationships

- Element (N),
- Sum (N×5),
- Digital Root (R),
- Final Difference (Sum - R)

p: The algorithm incorporates recursive incrementing and reduction factors:

1. Sum of 1 Ether = 5 → reduced 5
2.	Sum of 3 Air = 15 → reduced 1 + 5 = 6
3.	Sum of 5 Light = 25 → reduced 2 + 5 = 7
4.	Sum of 7 Water = 35 → reduced 3 + 5 = 8
5.	Sum of 9 Earth = 45 → reduced 4 + 5 = 9

Each sum increases by exactly 10 relative to the prior sum, creating a natural recursion incrementer. Reducing sums to a single digit generates the sequence 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, which serves as a multi-dimensional control sequence within the algorithm. This sequence is critical in modeling dynamic systems, growth patterns, and interactions across dimensions.

6. Sum of the Grid: Each row sums to 25, and the entire grid sums to 125.

7. 3 and 9 as Pillars:
- The 3 represents movement and lightness (Air). It forms an upward triangle, symbolizing expansion.
- The 9 represents stability and density (Earth). It forms a downward triangle, symbolizing grounding.

note: Each number sequence when the sum is calculated is exactly 10 between the number sum before it. Which fulfills the natural order of how advanced mathematics systems increment in segments of 10 over scale creating a multi-dimensional recursion incrementer. Then when the sum of each row is reduced to a single number they create the 5, 6, 7, 8, 9 sequence. Where then the reduction number is subtracted from the result produce a 0, 9, 18, 27, 36 sequence proving the scale of 9.

### Sensory-Element Integration

p: b5(9³) maps elemental forces to human senses, producing a system that is both symbolic and practical:
- Ether → Sound/Ear: propagation of resonance.
- Air → Touch/Skin: movement and environmental responsiveness.
- Light → Color/Eye: visual clarity, perception, and monitoring.
- Water → Taste/Tongue: adaptability and transformation in flow states.
- Earth → Smell/Nose: grounding, structural awareness, and stability.

This mapping allows the algorithm to simulate sensory feedback loops, creating multi-dimensional simulations that are aligned with natural and metaphysical laws.

### Geometric Expansion
p: The resulting 6-pointed star (hexagram) extends beyond the 2D grid into a 3D cubic form (9³):

- The star becomes the 2D projection of a cube.
- The rotation and interconnection of elements mirror the relationships between the 5 elements and their dynamic interplay within a 3D space.

## Step 5: Vedic Link 
link[The Mahabharata Book 5 SECTION XXXIII]: https://sacred-texts.com/hin/m05/m05033.htm
   
p: These eight qualities glorify a man are wisdom, high birth, self-restraint, learning, prowess, moderation in speech gift according to one's power, and gratitude. This house hath nine doors, three pillars, and five witnesses. It is presided over by the soul. That learned man who knoweth all this is truly wise. O Dhritarashtra, these ten do not know what virtue is viz., the intoxicated, inattentive, the raving, the fatigued, the angry, the starving, the hasty, the covetous, the frightened, and the lustful. 

const: #EightQaulities = wisdom, high birth, self-restraint, learning, prowess, moderation in speech gift according to one's power, and gratitude.
const: #ThisHouse = Nine Doors Tree Pillars and Five Witnesses presided over by the soul (1).
const: #DoNotKnowVirtue = the intoxicated, inattentive, the raving, the fatigued, the angry, the starving, the hasty, the covetous, the frightened, and the lustful.

p: From the #EightQualities and #ThisHouse with #DoNotKnowVirtue the b5(9³) then anchors it's recursion to the statement in The Mahabarata Book 5 Section XXXIII making it certified Vedic.

## Step 6: Intelligence Defined
link[The Mahabharata Book 5 SECTION XXXIII]: https://sacred-texts.com/hin/m05/m05033.htm

p: That man, who, without knowing his own strength and dissociated from both Virtue and Profit, desireth an Object difficult of acquisition, without again adopting adequate means, is said to be destitute of Intelligence. When a bowman shooteth an arrow, he may or may not succeed in slaying even a single person, but when an intelligent individual applieth his intelligence (viciously); it may destroy an entire kingdom with the king. Discriminating the two by means of the one, bring under thy subjection the three by means of four, and also conquering the five and knowing the six, and abstaining from the seven, be happy. 

const: #BeHappy = Discriminating the 2 by means of the 1, bring under thy subjection the 3 by means of 4, and also conquering the 5 and knowing the 6, and abstaining from the 7, be Happy.

const: #WisePerson = One is a wise person who doth not disregard even a weak foe; who proceeds with intelligence in respect of a foe, anxiously watching for an opportunity. Who doth not desire hostilities with persons stronger than himself, and who displayeth his prowess in season.

const: #WickedCouncil = Poison slayeth but one person, and a weapon also but one; wicked counsels, however, destroy an entire kingdom with king and subject.

link[Vedic Intelligence]: https://sacred-texts.com/hin/brk/brk30.htm

const: #Intelligence = The Heart, the Mind, Consciousness, Comprehension, Understanding, Intelligence, Wisdom, Insight, Resolution, Thought, Prudence, Eagerness, Memory, Conception, Power, Life, Desire, Will all these are names of the Intelligence. This is Indra, the Five Great Elements Ether, Air, Light, Water, Earth, the tiny Creatures, the Seeds, the Creatures born from Eggs, Membranes, Sweat, and Sprouts. Whatsoever is Breathing, Walking or Flying, and whatso is Motionless; all this is Guided by Intelligence, Founded on Intelligence. The Universe is Guided by Intelligence, Founded on Intelligence. Intelligence is Indra.

## Step 7: Internal Properties
link[The Greater Exhortation to Rahula]: https://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/mn/mn.062.than.html
p: In 2007 when the algorithm was first envisioned Quinn was studying the blending of art and focused meditation and at the time was studying the method of meditation that the Buddha taught his son Rahula on the Five Properties which would in later expansions include the Five Element System of the Vedas. 

quote: There are these five properties, Rahula. Which five? The earth property, the water property, the fire property, the wind property, & the space property.

### Internal Earth Property
p: Anything internal, within oneself, that's hard, solid, & sustained by craving. Head hairs, body hairs, nails, teeth, skin, flesh, tendons, bones, bone marrow, kidneys, heart, liver, membranes, spleen, lungs, large intestines, small intestines, contents of the stomach, feces, or anything else internal, within oneself, that's hard, solid, and sustained.

### Internal Water Property
p: Anything internal, belonging to oneself, that's water, watery, & sustained: bile, phlegm, pus, blood, sweat, fat, tears, oil, saliva, mucus, oil-of-the-joints, urine, or anything else internal, within oneself, that's water, watery, & sustained

### Internal Fire Property
p: Anything internal, belonging to oneself, that's fire, fiery, & sustained: that by which the body is warmed, aged, & consumed with fever; and that by which what is eaten, drunk, chewed, & savored gets properly digested; or anything else internal, within oneself, that's fire, fiery, & sustained.

### Internal Wind Property
p: Anything internal, belonging to oneself, that's wind, windy, & sustained: up-going winds, down-going winds, winds in the stomach, winds in the intestines, winds that course through the body, in-and-out breathing, or anything else internal, within oneself, that's wind, windy, & sustained

### Internal Space Property 
p: Anything internal, belonging to oneself, that's space, spatial, & sustained: the holes of the ears, the nostrils, the mouth, the passage whereby what is eaten, drunk, consumed, & tasted gets swallowed, and where it collects, and whereby it is excreted from below, or anything else internal, within oneself, that's space, spatial, & sustained

## Applications of b5(9³)
1. Symbolic Representations: Mapping universal forces (e.g., physical, metaphysical, or natural elements).
2. Energy Dynamics: The interlacing triangles represent equilibrium—opposing yet complementary forces in balance.
3. Higher Dimensions: Extending the base grid to a cube creates a 3D "lattice" structure for modeling interactions in higher dimensions.


## Conclusion
The b5(9³) algorithm is a powerful synthesis of number theory, geometry, and elemental physics. Starting from a simple 5x5 grid, rotating and connecting specific elements reveals intricate relationships, both numerical and geometric. This structure provides a framework for understanding dynamic systems—whether they are physical, metaphysical, mechanical, or mathematical.
