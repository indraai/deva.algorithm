# Tridandin Algorithm 

const: #Tridandin = That man is called a true Tridandin in whose mind these three, the control over his speech (#Vagdanda), the control over his thoughts (#Manodanda), and the control over his body (#Kayadanda), are firmly fixed. That man who keeps this threefold control over himself with respect to all created beings and wholly subdues desire and wrath, thereby assuredly gains complete success.
