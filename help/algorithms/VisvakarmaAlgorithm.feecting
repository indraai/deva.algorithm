# #VisvakarmaAlgorithm

l: There gleamed the car with wealth untold of precious gems and burnished gold.
l: By Visvakarma's self proclaimed the noblest work his hand had framed.
l: Uplifted in the air it glowed bright as the sun's diurnal road.
l: The eye might scan the wondrous frame and vainly seek one spot to blame.
l: So fine was every part and fair with gems inlaid with lavish care.

l: Obedient to the master's will it moves o'er wood and towering hill.
l: A glorious marvel well designed by Visvakarma's artist mind.

l: Adorned with every fair device that decks the cars of Paradise.
l: Swift moving as the master chose as it flies through air or sank or rose.

l: And in its fleetness left behind The fury of the rushing wind.
l: Meet mansion for the good and great, the holy, wise, and fortunate.

l: Throughout the chariot's vast extent are chambers wide and excellent.
l: All pure and lovely to the eyes as moonlight shed from cloudless skies.

l: Who cleft the clouds with swiftest flight in countless hosts that chariot drew.
