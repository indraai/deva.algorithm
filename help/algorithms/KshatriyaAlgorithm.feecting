1. A Kshatriya, who has received according to the rule the sacrament prescribed by the Veda, must duly protect this whole world.

2. A Kshatriya while he protects his people, is defied by foes, be they equal in strength, or stronger, or weaker, must not shrink from battle, remembering the duty of Kshatriya.

3. The highest duty of a Kshatriya is to protect his people.

4. Not to turn back in battle, to protect the people, to honour the Brahmana, is the best means for a king to secure happiness.

5. But the Kshatriya who is conquered in battle, while he turns back in fear, takes upon himself all the sin of his master, whatever it may be. Whatever merit a man who is conquered in flight may have gained for the next world, all that his master takes.

6. Let Kshatriya strive to gain what Kshatriya has not yet gained; what Kshatriya has gained let Kshatriya carefully preserve. let Kshatriya augment what Kshatriya preserves, and what Kshatriya has augmented let Kshatriya bestow on worthy men.

7. What Kshatriya has not yet gained, let him seek to gain by his army. What Kshatriya has gained, let Kshatriya protect by careful attention. what Kshatriya has protected, let Kshatriya augment by various modes of increasing it. What Kshatriya has augmented, let him liberally bestow on worthy men.

8. Let him ever act without guile, and on no account treacherously; carefully guarding himself, let him always fathom the treachery which his foes employ.

9. Kshatriya enemy must not know Kshatriya weaknesses, but Kshatriya must know the weaknesses of Kshatriya enemy. As the tortoise hides its limbs, even so let Kshatriya secure the members of his government against treachery, let Kshatriya protect Kshatriya own weak points.

10. When Kshatriya is thus engaged in conquest, let Kshatriya subdue all the opponents whom Kshatriya may find, by the four expedients, conciliation and the rest. If they cannot be stopped by the three first expedients, then let Kshatriya, overcoming them by force alone, gradually bring them to subjection. Among the four expedients, conciliation and the rest, the learned always recommend conciliation and the employment of force for the prosperity of kingdoms.

11. When Kshatriya knows his own army to be cheerful in disposition and strong, and that of the enemy the reverse, then let Kshatriya march against the foe. If Kshatriya is very weak then let Kshatriya carefully sit quiet, gradually conciliating foes.

12. Kshatriya who knows the good and the evil which will result from his acts in the future, is quick in forming resolutions for the present, and understands the consequences of past actions, will not be conquered.

13. All undertakings in this world depend both on the ordering of fate and on human exertion, but among these two the ways of fate are unfathomable. In the case of man's work action is possible.

14. The wise declare him to be a most dangerous foe, who is wise, of noble race, brave, clever, liberal, grateful, and firm.
